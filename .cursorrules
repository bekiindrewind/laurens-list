# Lauren's List - Cursor Rules

## API Integration Rules

When integrating or fixing API issues:
1. **ALWAYS find and read the official API documentation first** before trying various approaches
2. **Verify the correct endpoint URLs, request methods (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE), and required headers**
3. **Check the actual response format from the API** rather than assuming it matches our code
4. **Use the API documentation as the source of truth**, not guesswork or assumptions
5. **Test with simple examples from the documentation** before implementing complex integrations

## Code Quality

- Keep implementations simple and straightforward
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- When something doesn't work, revert and try a different approach based on documentation
- Prefer checking documentation over trial-and-error

## Testing

- Always test API integrations with real requests and verify responses match documentation
- Log API responses to understand actual data structures
- When responses don't match expectations, check the documentation first
