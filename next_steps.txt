DONE security - cleanse inputs
            confirmm no visible keys
            run snyk or whatever

next steps:

FIXED - DEADPOOL - came up as safe. wikipedia plot summary mentions cancer.
Guardians of the galaxy movies 1 and 2 - both came up safe, shouldnt be. not found in wikipedia plot summary.., keep looking



DONE - regression testing -new branch?
create experimental branch and when "Movie" is selected, have it check to see if the movie is based on a book. if that book also contains cancer or related terms weshould mark it as not recommended.
maybe also update logic so that if any high-confidence cancer terms are found in a single source, we no longer need to check the other sources. this should speed up the process.

are there any other cancer-related books or movies that we could test against?



change the order of the confidence levels so that they are in descending order by confidence.


fix false positive from H

spin this off into a templated deployment process


False positives:

DONE my oxford year movie
DON step mom (book?) movie?

Not sure it is worth it  -false positives for astrology books? worth it?
